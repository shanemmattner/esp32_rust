This project will combine all concepts learned in embedded and Rust with the Olimex ESP32-C3 as the target.

Concepts I hope to cover:
- FreeRTOS tasks and queues
- CLI
- I2C
- SPI
- ADC
- Timers
- Interrupts
- UART
- MQTT

Throughout this project I will try to keep in line with Rust and embedded best practices.
